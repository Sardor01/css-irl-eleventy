## The web’s most beautiful language

CSS { In Real Life } is a blog about front end technologies, with a particular focus on CSS – which I consider to be the web’s most beautiful language. Not only is it the language that literally makes the web beautiful (consider how our web pages would look without it), I find it an absolute joy to write.

CSS is constantly evolving, and in recent years it’s moved along faster than ever. We now have CSS Grid, custom properties, feature queries, and CSS shapes, as well as features like blend modes, masking, clipping and filters that enable us to produce graphical effects in the browser. The list goes on and on, and there’s always something new to get excited about. Us CSS developers are becoming more powerful by the day.

CSS is the language that made me fall in love with web development, and it’s still the language that fills me with the most excitement. Indeed, some of what it can do feels truly magical. This blog is a love letter to CSS, and the community it serves.

## The journey so far

I’ve always loved writing, and I started this blog in 2018 in order to carve out my own little corner of the internet. I’d published a few articles on [Codepen]() which ended up being quite popular, but I liked the idea of publishing on my own platform. My goal was (and still is) to write honestly and pragmatically about my front end learnings, acknowledging any limitations (my own and the technology’s). I treat it first and foremost as a place of reference for myself (I frequently refer back to my blog posts when I need to remind myself how to do something), but I hope it will also help others find their own way, and demonstrate a few tips and tricks unfamiliar to some readers.

What I love about working in this industry (and especially with CSS) is the community’s willingness to share knowledge and help and support each other. To this end, CSS { In Real Life } now has a [blogroll](/blogroll), listing some of the blogs that have helped and influenced me, and which I love reading. I hope you’ll discover some hidden gems on there too.
